Created by Shonda Rhimes, it debuted on ABC on April 5, 2012.[1] Kerry Washington's character, Olivia Pope, is partially based on former George H.W. Bush administration press aide Judy Smith, who serves as a co-executive producer.[2]

    The show takes place in Washington, D.C. and focuses on Olivia Pope's crisis management firm, Olivia Pope and Associates, and its staff, as well as staff at the White House and surrounding political scene, which includes President Fitzgerald Grant III, White House Chief of Staff Abigail Whelan, Attorney General David Rosen, Vice President Susan Ross, the Vice President's Chief of Staff Elizabeth North, ex-First Lady and now President-Elect Mellie Grant, NSA Director Jake Ballard, and ex-White House Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene. In addition to Kerry Washington, the show features Guillermo Diaz and Katie Lowes as assistants at O.P.A.; Tony Goldwyn as the President; Bellamy Young as the ex-First Lady and senator; Jeff Perry as the former White House Chief of Staff; Darby Stanchfield as the White House Press Secretary and current Chief of Staff; Joshua Malina as the Attorney General; Scott Foley as the Director of the NSA; Portia de Rossi as the Vice President's Chief of Staff; Cornelius Smith Jr. as a civil rights activist and associate at O.P.A.; and Joe Morton as Olivia's father and the former head of a spy agency called B613.

    The show was named a Television Program of the Year by the American Film Institute, received the Peabody Award for Excellence in Television and was honored as Outstanding Drama Series at the Image Awards. Washington has won the Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series and has been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series, and a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Drama Series.</p>

    <p id="section-two">Production and development[edit]
    Conception[edit]
    Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching,[4] and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another".[5] When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded:

    “	I was obsessed with the surgery channels. [...] My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the Discovery Channel. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting.[6]	”
    The series was pitched to ABC Entertainment, who gave the green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season.[7] Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that "[m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it."[5]

    "ER is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is."

    — Rhimes on the creation of Grey's Anatomy[6]
    Rhimes initially conceived Grey's Anatomy as a statement against racism. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.[8] While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.[6] Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters. Rhimes offered her insight on this, "I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?"[6]

    Before the series debuted on March 27, 2005, there were a few early releases to close friends and family of the producers and actors. The show was scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season.[5] ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [Grey's Anatomy] build on its tremendous momentum through May."[9] The show's title, Grey's Anatomy, was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's medical textbook, Gray's Anatomy, and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo).[10] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.[11]

    Production team[edit]
    Grey's Anatomy is produced by ShondaLand, in association with The Mark Gordon Company, and ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television).[12] Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff, Mark Gordon, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding have all served as executive producers throughout the course of the series.[13] In subsequent seasons, Steve Mulholland, Kent Hodder, Nancy Bordson, James D. Parriott, and Peter Horton have also been executive producers, with Allan Heinberg joining the show in 2006 in this role.[13] As of season eight, the current executive producers are Rhimes, Beers, Gordon, Vernoff, Corn, Wilding, and Heinberg.[14]

    Rhimes is the series' most prolific writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account.[15] Other members of the writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn.[13] From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where the writer of an episode discussed the motives behind the writing.[16] Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed a substantial number of episodes.[13] Cast members Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have both directed multiple episodes.[17]

    Grey's Anatomy has been edited by Susan Vaill since the show's inception,[18] and David Greenspan was named an editor in 2006.[19] Casting directors Linda Lowy and John Brace have been a part of the production team since 2005. Production design is led by Donald Lee Harris, assisted by art director Brian Harms, and costume design is led by Mimi Melgaard. Working alongside Melgaard, Thomas Houchins supervises costumes, Ellen Vieira is the makeup artist, and Jerilynn Stevens serves as a hair stylist. The Director of Photography is Herbert Davis. The music coordinator is Danny Lux.[18] Karen Lisa Pike, M.D. is the on-set medical consultant, alongside Linda Klein, a RN.[20] The production staff is part of a Grey's Anatomy softball team that competes against other television shows, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.[21]
