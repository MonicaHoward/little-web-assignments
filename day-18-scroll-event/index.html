      <section class="taylor-quote">
        <p>I'm intimidated by the fear of being average.
          No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.
          People haven't always been there for me but music always has.
          Just be yourself, there is no one better.
          I never want to change so much that people can't recognize me.
          If you're horrible to me, I'm going to write a song about it, and you won't like it. That's how I operate.
          giving up doesn't always mean your weak sometimes your just strong enough to let go
          I suffer from girlnextdooritis where the guy is friends with you and that's it.
          I've wanted one thing for me whole life and I'm not going to be that girl who wants one thing her whole life then gets it and complains.
          All you need to do to be my friend is like me.</p>
