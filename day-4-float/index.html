Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Mogul talk. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion! The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. </p>

    <p>They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. We the best. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Fan luv. It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. I’m up to something. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.</p>
